# LeetCode Solutions

These are my solutions to the LeetCode problems.

I've tried to adhere to the following for each solution:

- Easily understood
- Optimized for performance
- Using only the standard libraries for the chosen language

Most solutions are in Swift with the exception of those requiring big numbers or when I'm in the mood to try something different.

*TODO: Add a link to blog detailing decisions made for each solution.*
